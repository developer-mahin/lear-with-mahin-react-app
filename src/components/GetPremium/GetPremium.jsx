                  You can understand that by looking at the course curriculum.
                  But in short, this course has everything you need to become a
                  serious web developer these days. In short, from HTML, CSS to
                  bootstrap, JavaScript, Git, ES6, REST API, server, JSON are
                  there. At the same time, there is a system for making complete
                  websites with React, the framework that currently has the most
                  jobs. In addition, there are many other things including node,
                  database (mongodb), debug, problem solving, interview
                  questions. And in the whole course you will be shown 11
                  websites.

                  Course videos will be pre-recorded. You open an account and
                  enroll in this course. Videos will be given one module per day
                  from the start of the course. Each module usually has 10 to 12
                  videos. You have to finish watching these videos within the
                  day they are released. Therefore, dedicated time should be
                  kept daily for the course. And during that time, you can watch
                  the video lying down, standing, leaning, swinging your legs,
                  dancing, or even hiding under the bed.

                  First, it takes dedicated time. Mast 6-8 hours per day. 8-10
                  hours if possible (If you can't give time. If you don't want
                  to do hard work, there will be no benefit in enrolling in the
                  course.) Secondly you will need a laptop or a computer (where
                  software like node, Visual Studio Code can be installed) and
                  thirdly you will need minimum 2 - 10 Mbps internet. Broadband
                  is preferred so that the course videos can be viewed well. To
                  become a professional web developer, minimum 4 months of
                  serious hard work should be kept in mind.
